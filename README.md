### Hey! I'm Luiz

I'm a Molecular Sciences undergraduate student at USP.

My main interests lie within:

- Computer graphics
- Game engine development
- Performance-oriented low-level programming in general

I also love studying high-level mathematics, mostly algebraic topology!

My go-to languages are C, C++, Rust and a tiny bit of Python.
