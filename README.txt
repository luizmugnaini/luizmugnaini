Yo!

I'm currently doing my Master's in CS at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

My main interests lie within:

- Computer graphics
- Game development
- Performance-oriented low-level programming in general
- Algebraic topology and differential geometry

 *
 * - My projects are now hosted at https://git.sr.ht/~presheaf and development
 *   of my projects will only continue there - all repositories here are stale.
 * - This account will be used solely for interacting with projects hosted here.
 *
 * Why? Because we need to take hold of our freedom back from the monopolies,
 * which are draining data from us daily for their own profit - while we gain
 * nothing but ads and indirect manipulation in return.
 *
 * We can still collaborate and share knowledge via other more secure channels.
 * Remember, if you don't pay for the service, your soul is the payment.
